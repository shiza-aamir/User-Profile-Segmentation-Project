# User Profiles Analysis and Clustering
# Overview
This project involves analyzing user profile data to segment users into distinct clusters using KMeans clustering. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization to understand user behaviors and preferences.

Key Steps

  1.Data Import and Cleaning: Loaded and cleaned the dataset, handling missing values and checking data types.
  
  2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key demographic variables and engagement metrics using seaborn and matplotlib.
  
  3.Segmentation: Applied KMeans clustering to group users based on selected features.
  
  4.Cluster Analysis: Calculated mean values and modes for features within each cluster and visualized the results.
  
  5.Visualization: Created radar charts and bar plots to illustrate cluster characteristics using matplotlib and Plotly.
  
Usage

  1.Load the Dataset: pd.read_csv("user_profiles_for_ads.csv")
  
  2.Run Data Cleaning and Analysis: Follow the steps outlined in the code.
  
  3.Visualize Results: Generate plots to view distributions, engagement metrics, and cluster characteristics.
